# This creates a tab delimited txt with the min max median and mean pitch (Hz) 
# of a sound object as well as the object's duration (sec)
# Added amplitude analyses as well

# Make sure that you only have the sound files you want analyzed in your objects window
# and that the Praat info window doesn't have anything in it (e.g. is closed or blank)

# Change the .txt file name at the very bottom, if necessary
