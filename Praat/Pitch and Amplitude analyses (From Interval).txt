# This creates a tab delimited txt with the pitch, amplitude and duration information  
# for all labeled intervals in a text grid. The file will be named AnalysesFor<SOUNDFILE>

# Select TextGrid and Sound object to perform analyses
# Only have the TextGrid and Sound Objects in the Objects window, to avoid accidentally deleting sound files you're working on
